## Getting Started
> The project is still in beta. Consider reporting bugs to help development and release a stable version;

### Download `pyappimage`

* Choose the Python Version. Currently, the supported Python versions are `3.6`, `3.7` and `3.8`. 
These AppImages are built using [python-appimage](https://github.com/niess/python-appimage) which 
includes the Python Interpreter. See [why not `pyappimage`](#why-not-pyappimage) section for more
details. Corresponding to the python version, binaries will be built, using [PyInstaller]
(https://github.com/PyInstaller/PyInstaller) and are processed to make the necessary changes.

* Get the latest `pyappimage.AppImage` to begin development

### PyAppImage tutorial 

Here are some small tutorials to package some applications, and to workaround bugs when packaging software

1. Hello World AppImage
2. [Packaging Archivy](guides/archivy.md)
3. [Packaging AppImageLint](guides/appimagelint.md)



### Configuration parameters
`pyappimage` can be configured using the following parameters

#### `entrypoint`
Entrypoint is a path to the function. It is normally in the format
```python
folder.script:function
```
here, the function located in `script` file, of which the script file is
 located in the `folder` called `folder` is executed.

<br>

#### `environment_vars`

Environment variables can be set before the appimage entrypoint is called. This can be useful in defining AppImage based variables or conditionally executing some functions when the app is being run within an appimage, 

```
"environment_vars": {
	"HELLO": "TEST"
}
```

This will be translated to 

```bash
export HELLO=TEST
```

<br>

#### `pyappimage_data`

These are `data` objects, including items like `png`, `json`, `txt` items which you would like to place in the AppImage. Just simple add

```
"pyappimage_data": ["$CWD/somefile/photo.png:$APPIMAGE/photo.png", "/usr/share/icons/myphoto.svg:$APPIMAGE/icons/icon.png"]
```

<br>

#### Custom Icon

Place `<appname>.png` in the `pyappimage` directory, and it will be automatically set as the AppImage dir icon. 

<br>

#### Custom Desktop File

`pyappimage` automatically generates the desktop file for you. If you want to override the desktop file generated by `pyappimage`, you can add a `<appname>.desktop` desktop file in the `pyappimage` directory, and that will be added. Make sure that your desktop file matches FreeDesktop's standards.
